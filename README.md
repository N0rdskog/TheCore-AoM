We are collectively developing an ergonomically optimized hotkey setup for Age of Mythology based on the StarCraft 2 hotkey setup TheCore. 

If you want to play AoM with better hotkeys please consider helping out. By adding your knowledge or two cents here on github we can make it better than any one person can. 
Any feedback or suggestions are welcome. That also applies to the structure of this github project. 

As some of you may already know changing your hotkeys in AoM can be an involved process. This repository can be a good place to add your expertise and link to other condensed and solid resources for figuring out what's necessary to change your hotkeys. 

This project aims to be ready for the release of AoM: Retold with a basic setup that can be iterated on as soon as we know what we are working with.
